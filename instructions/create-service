[Unit] - contains generic options that are not dependent on the type of the unit.
These options provide unit description, specify the unit's behavior, and set 
dependencies to other units.


Option		Description

Description	A meaningfull description of the unit. This is text displayed
		for example in the output of the "systemctl status" command.

Documentation	Provides a list of URIs referincing documentation fo rthe unit.

After		Defines the order in which units are started. The unit starts 
		only after the units specified in "After" are active. Unlike 
		"Requires", "After" does not explicitly activate the specified
		units. The "Before" option has the opposite functionality of 
		"After".

Requires	Configures dependencies on other units. The units listed in
		"Required" are activated together with the unit. If any of the 
		required units fail to start, the unit is not activated.

Wants		Configures waker dependencies than "Requires". If any of the
		listed units does not start successfully, it has no impact 
		on the unit activation. This is the recommanded way to establish
		custom unit dependencies.

Conflicts	Configures negative dependencies, an opposite to "Requires"

[Unit type] - if a unit has type-specific directives, these are grouped uner a
section named after the unit type. For example, service unit files contain the
[Service] section.


Option		Description 

Type		Configures the unit process startup type that affects the
		functionality of "ExecStart" and related options. One of:
		- "simple" - The default value. The process started with
		  "ExecStart" is the main process of the service.
		- "forking" - The process started with "ExecStart" spawns a
		  child process that becomes the main process of the service.
		  The parent process exits when the startup is complete.
		- "oneshot" - This type is similar to "simple", but the process
		  exits before starting consequent units.
		- "dbus" - This type is similar to "simple", but conequent 
		  units are started only after the main process gains a D-bus
		  name.
		- "notify simple" - This type is similar to "simple", but 
		  conequent units are started only after a notification message
		  is sent via the sd_notify() function.
		- "idle" - similar to "simple", the actual execution of the 
		  service binary is delayed until all jobs are finished, which
		  avoids mixing the status output with shell output of service.

ExecStart	Specifies commands or scripts to be executed when the unit is 
		started. "ExecStartPre" and "ExecStartPost" specify custom
		commands to be executed before and after "ExecStart"
		"Type=oneshot" enables specifying multiple custom commands
		that are then executed sequentially.

ExecStop	Specifies commands or scripts to be executed when the unit is
		stopped.

ExecReload	Specifies commands or scripts to be executed when the unit is
		reloaded.

Restart		With this option enabled, the service is restarted after its
		process exits, with the exception of a clean stop by the 
		"systemctl" command.

RemainAfterExit	If set to True, the service is considered active even when all
		its processes exited. Default value is False. This option is
		especially useful if "Type=oneshot" is configured.

[Install] - contains infomatino about unit installation used by "system enable"
and "disable" commands.


Option		Description

Alias		Provides a space-separated list of additional names for the 
		unit. Most "systemctl" commands, including "systemctl enable",
		can use aliases instead of the actual unit name.

RequiredBy	A list of units that depend on the unit. When this unit is 
		enabled, the units listed in "RequiredBy" gain a "Require"
		dependency on the unit.

WantedBy	A list of units that weakly depend on the unit. When this unit
		is enabled, the units listed in "WantedBy" gain a "Want"
		dependency on the unit.

Also		Specifies a list of units to be installed or uninstalled along
		with the unit

DefaultInstance	Limited to instatiated units, this option specifies the default
		instance for which the unit is enabled.
